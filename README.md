# Don't Save
This is a mod for [Rogue Tower](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1843760/Rogue_Tower/). It disables saving for mod development/testing purposes.

If you want to write a mod for Rogue Tower or test something and don't want to affect your progression, you can install this mod. Once installed, no data will be saved to disk. (There will be a warning in the title screen indicating the mod is working.) The game will still start with your current progression. It is just the future progress you make will not be persisted.

## Installation
1. [Install BepInEx](https://rogue-tower.thunderstore.io/package/bbepis/BepInEx_Rogue_Tower/).
2. Run the game and exit to create the required directory structure.
3. Download this mod and extract DontSave.dll into `<Rogue Tower installation location>/BepInEx/plugins`.
4. Enjoy (?)

Alternatively, you might be able to install this mod with [Thunderstore Mod Manager](https://thunderstore.io/). I have not tested it. Let me know if it doesn't work.

## Recommendations
You may also want to install [Harb's DisableTriumphs](https://rogue-tower.thunderstore.io/package/Harb/DisableTriumphs/) which will disable achievements.
